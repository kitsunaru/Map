I found part of this business card while on holiday, except I can't figure out the name of the area this business card is from, the country, or what the percentage "%" stands for...

Flag format: `pecan{AreaName_CountryName_PlaceName}`

The player should be trying to look up the names of buildings, Manhattan Heights specifically or taking note of the road names surrounding the areas. The district name "Kennedy Town" in "Hong Kong" should come up. The player then needs to look on Google Maps for where the % symbol is, which stands for "% Arabica".
